Investing Scrapper of continuous Spanish stock market
=====================================================
Since `Investing <https://es.investing.com/>`_ does not have an API to retrieve
historical data of the continuous spanish stock market, I decided to create a scrapper
to retrieve that information.
Mainly I decided to create this scrapper in order to get the exact data I want
for my Final Degree Project in the University of Salamanca.
So, to sum up, this is not a professional scrapper, it's just a solution to solve my problem,
but I will continue updating it, since this is just the pre-alpha version of it. So you can
retrieve more information indexed in Investing.
