Investing Scrapper of continuous Spanish stock market
=====================================================

-----------------
Introduction
-----------------

Since `Investing <https://es.investing.com/>`_ does not have an API to retrieve
historical data of the continuous spanish stock market, I decided to create a scrapper
to retrieve that information.

I developed this scrapper in order to get the data I need
for my Final Degree Project at the University of Salamanca named "Machine Learning for stock investment recommendation systems".

To sum up this is not the final version of this scrapper since this is just the pre-alpha version of it. So I will continue scrapping information indexed in investing so you can be able to retrieve more data, as soon as I can.
