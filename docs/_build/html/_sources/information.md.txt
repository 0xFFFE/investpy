# Additional Information

The package is currently in a development version, so please, if needed open an [issue](https://github.com/alvarob96/investpy/issues) to solve all the possible problems the package may be causing
so I fix them as fast as I can. Also, any new ideas or proposals are welcome, and I will gladly implement them in the package if the are positive and useful.
