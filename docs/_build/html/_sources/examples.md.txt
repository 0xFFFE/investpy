## GitHub Gists on investpy use

In order to explain the use of [**investpy**](https://pypi.org/project/investpy/), some self-explanatory gists have been created and they can be found at [my GitHub Gist Page](https://gist.github.com/alvarob96). As the package is updated with new functionality, gists will be updated so they can be easily tested and provide useful information for investpy use.
